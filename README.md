# 🚀 InternBoot - Automated Level Assessment & Certification Platform

Welcome to the **InternBoot** unified core repository! InternBoot is an automated level assessment, batch slot allocation, exam delivery, and certification platform built with **Core PHP**, **MySQL**, and **Vanilla JS / Bootstrap**, deployed on **Railway.app**.

---

## 1. Overview

InternBoot manages the candidate assessment lifecycle from user registration and eligibility payment to batch/slot booking, online MCQ exam execution, automated evaluation, skill level assignment (Levels 1–5), PDF certificate generation, and placement tracking.

### Core Architecture Principles:
1. **Unified Codebase:** Single canonical source of truth organized into modular business layers (`/src/modules/`) and shared core utilities (`/src/core/`).
2. **3-Layer Architecture:** Public API endpoints parse requests (`controller.php`) $\to$ execute business rules (`service.php`) $\to$ perform database queries (`queries.php`).
3. **Database Concurrency & Integrity:** MySQL prepared statements everywhere, atomic slot seat decrements (`seats_remaining > 0`), row locking (`FOR UPDATE`), and foreign key constraints.

---

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Core PHP (PHP 8.x)
- **Database:** MySQL 8.0 (Railway.app Cloud Instance)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), Vanilla CSS / Bootstrap 5, Lucide Icons
- **PDF Generation:** Native PDF Stream Handler
- **Deployment:** Railway.app Cloud Hosting

## 3. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Mock Payment Flow

> **TODO / PRE-PRODUCTION BLOCKER:** The current payment gateway integration (`public/api/payment/payment.php`) is a **mock flow for development and testing only**. It blindly accepts payments in demo mode. Before real production launch, this MUST be replaced with a real gateway (e.g., PayU, Easebuzz, Razorpay) featuring a secure, server-to-server webhook signature verification.

---

## 4. Local Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the platform locally:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Open your terminal in the project root directory and run Composer to install required backend packages (`phpmailer/phpmailer`, `tecnickcom/tcpdf`):
```bash
composer install
```
> ⚠️ **Prerequisite:** Ensure Composer and the PHP `zip` extension are installed/enabled on your system. This generates the `vendor/` directory containing required autoloaders.

### Step 2: Configure Environment (`.env`)
Copy `.env.example` to create your private `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your local or Railway database credentials, along with SMTP credentials for OTP email verification:
```env
APP_ENV=development
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Database Configuration (Local MySQL or Railway public proxy)
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_local_password
DB_NAME=railway

# DEV/DEMO ONLY (Mock payment & candidate impersonation guard)
M4_DEMO_MODE=0
M4_DEMO_SECRET=your_local_demo_secret_here

# SMTP Mail Configuration (Required for M3 candidate registration & OTP verification)
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_smtp_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@internboot.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="InternBoot"
```
> ⚠️ **STRICT WARNING:** Never commit `.env` to Git! It is excluded by `.gitignore`.

### Step 3: Serve the Application
The web server's **document root MUST point to the `public/` folder**, never the repository root.

**PHP Built-in Server (Recommended for local dev):**
```bash
# Run from repository root:
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Document Root Requirement**
> - **PHP CLI:** Always specify `-t public`. Running `php -S localhost:8000` without `-t public` serves from the repository root, breaking all stylesheets (`/css/style.css`), scripts, and API routes.
> - **XAMPP / Apache / Laragon / Nginx:** Configure your virtual host `DocumentRoot` (or site root) to the absolute path of `<repo>/public`, not the repo root.
> - **Troubleshooting:** If pages load unstyled with huge icons, your document root is pointed at the wrong folder — it must be public/, not the repo root.

### Accessing Interfaces & Diagnostic Endpoints:
- **Candidate Interface:** `http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html` (Registration: `/register.php`, Login: `/login.php`)
- **Admin Dashboard UI:** `http://localhost:8000/admin/index.html`
- **M7 Admin API Health Check:** `http://localhost:8000/api/admin/evaluate.php?action=health`

## 5. ⚡ First-Time Setup (Seed)

After applying the schema, a fresh database has no admin user, no assessment, and no question bank — making the platform unusable until these are created.

Run the seed script once to bootstrap all three:

```bash
# Step 1 — Apply schema (creates all tables)
php scripts/apply-schema.php

# Step 2 — Set seed credentials in your .env
# SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@internboot.com
# SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!
# SEED_ADMIN_NAME=Platform Admin

# Step 3 — Run the seeder
php scripts/seed.php
```

The seeder is **idempotent** — re-running it safely skips any step that has already been completed (it will not create duplicate rows or error out).

Seed output example:
```
[OK]   Admin user created — email: admin@internboot.com, id: 1
[OK]   Assessment created — title: "InternBoot Level Assessment", id: 1
[OK]   Question bank created — name: "Main Question Bank", id: 1, linked to assessment: 1
```

After seeding, log in at `/admin/index.html` with `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## 9. Payment Module Notes (M4)

- **Verification Approach Kept:** During restructuring, the payment verification mechanism from the Razorpay standalone demo was retained as canonical. It generates a 32-byte cryptographically secure session-bound token (`bin2hex(random_bytes(32))`) stored in `$_SESSION['m4_demo_payment']` and verifies verify requests using `hash_equals()`. Browser-supplied success flags are strictly ignored.
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET  /api/payment/payment.php?action=details` — Fetches candidate payment fee and current enrollment state.
  - `POST /api/payment/payment.php` (`{"action":"create", "assessment_id":1}`) — Creates a pending payment record and issues a verification token.
  - `POST /api/payment/payment.php` (`{"action":"verify", "payment_id":1, "token":"..."}`) — Performs server-side token verification, marks `payments.status = 'success'`, and updates `enrollments.eligibility_status = 'eligible'`.
  - `GET  /api/dashboard.php?candidate_id=1` — Returns complete dashboard status metrics.
  - `GET  /api/enrollment.php?candidate_id=1` — Returns candidate enrollment records.

---

## 10. M7 / Evaluation & Admin Notes

- **Admin Panel URL:** `http://localhost:8000/admin/index.html`
- **Admin Public API:** `/api/admin/evaluate.php`
- **Core Operations Supported:**
  - GET `?action=health`: Validates DB connection and confirms presence of schema tables.
  - GET `?action=dashboard`: Returns total candidates, payments, active batches, and level distribution statistics.
  - POST `?action=evaluate`: Accepts `{ "attempt_id": 1, "generate_certificate": true }`, evaluates submitted answers against `options.is_correct`, calculates percentage, assigns skill level (Level 1–5), inserts `results` row, generates certificate, and creates initial placement record.
  - GET `?action=certificate_pdf.php?result_id=1`: Renders/downloads candidate PDF certificate.
  - POST `?action=batch`, `?action=slot`, `?action=allocate`: Manages batch creation, slot times, and candidate seat allocations.
  - Security: All POST operations require CSRF protection (`X-CSRF-Token` header).

- **Public Certificate Verification:**
  - **URL:** `/verify-certificate.php`
  - **Access:** Public (no authentication required). Ideal for third-party background checks and employers.
  - **Functionality:** Accepts `certificate_number` via query parameter or form submission. Supports both web UI and JSON API (`format=json` or `Accept: application/json`).
  - **Privacy:** Returns strictly non-sensitive fields (`candidate_name`, `assessment_title`, `level`, `level_name`, `issue_date`, `verified: true/false`). Internal fields (email, percentage score, candidate_id) are strictly redacted.
  - **Rate Limiting:** Scoped by client IP, allowing a maximum of 20 verification requests per 15-minute window to protect against certificate number enumeration.

- **Certificate Issuance & Eligibility:**
  - Enforces minimum qualification gate (`settings.min_certificate_level`, default: Level 2 / Elementary, 40%+). Results for Level 1 (0–39.99%) or failing scores are rejected with `InvalidArgumentException`.
  - PDF rendering uses TCPDF with full TrueType Unicode font embedding (`FreeSans`), fully supporting Devanagari, Latin, and non-Latin character sets.

## 11. Module Notes (M3, M5, M6)

### M3 — Authentication & Profile
- Registration creates entries in `users` and `candidates` within a single SQL transaction.
- Hashing uses `password_hash()` (bcrypt).
- Session ID regeneration (`session_regenerate_id(true)`) occurs on every successful login.

### M5 — Batch & Slot Management
- **Threshold Batching:** Automatically groups eligible unbatched candidates once candidate count reaches `settings.batch_threshold` (default `100`).
- **Weekend Scheduling:** Date math automatically projects upcoming Saturday and Sunday exam dates.
- **Anti-Race-Condition Booking:** Slot seat reservation uses atomic UPDATE checks (`UPDATE exam_slots SET seats_remaining = seats_remaining - 1 WHERE id = ? AND seats_remaining > 0`) inside a transaction to prevent overselling.

### M6 — Online Exam Engine
- **Server-Authoritative Timer:** Server records start time and deadline (`end_time`). Submissions on in-progress attempts are accepted up to and upon expiration (triggering server-side answer evaluation); subsequent submissions against already-closed or unstarted attempts are rejected.
- **Deterministic Question Randomization:** Questions ordering is randomized per attempt using `ORDER BY MD5(CONCAT(attempt_id, ':', question_id))` without exposing answer keys (`options.is_correct`) to the frontend.
- **Browser Anti-Cheating:** Tracks tab/visibility changes (`visibilitychange`) and focus loss (`blur`). Exceeding 3 violations auto-submits the assessment.

## 12. Known Gaps & Future Roadmap Items

1. **AI Question Bank Auto-Generation:** Prompt-driven dynamic AI question generation endpoint is not yet fully wired to external LLM provider APIs.
2. **PDF Certificate Design Template:** PDF generation is active in M7 (`certificate_pdf.php`), but the visual layout uses a standard placeholder layout requiring final graphic styling.
3. **Evaluation Status-Check Bug:** Tracked for resolution in a separate pass following codebase restructuring.
4. **Database Connection Bootstrap Split:** Exam engine endpoints use `m6_exam_engine/config/database.php` while Core/Admin endpoints use `src/core/bootstrap.php`. Both resolve to identical credentials in `.env`, but should be refactored into a single connection helper in a future pass.
